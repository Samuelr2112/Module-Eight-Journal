  The steps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are requirements collection, requirements analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It is a methodical approach to project development. The sequential design method known as the Waterfall Model offers benefits like control, departmentalization, and simple comprehension of each stage. It is not appropriate, therefore, for intricate and expansive undertakings with ambiguous criteria.
  
Throughout the software development lifecycle, the Agile Methodology encourages constant iteration of testing and development. Large, complex projects work best with it because clients don't have to wait a long to view the finished product. The project's cost isn't set in stone, though.

The Product Owner, Scrum Master, Tech Lead, and Backlog Grooming meetings are members of the Agile Team. While the Scrum Master oversees the agile team members and gathers daily progress reports from them, the Product Owner is in charge of delivering the product to the client. Helping team members with technical problems is the responsibility of the technically proficient Tech Lead, who is well-versed in the entire project.

Creating user stories for needs in the project management application JIRA is known as backlog grooming. The Product Owner, Scrum Master, and all team members will be participating in this meeting to create user stories for requirements in JIRA and identify future work tasks.

Project folder structures, Git repositories creation, unit testing, exception handling, code review, client-side validations, Jenkins pipeline creation, deployment to DEV and QA, Sonar fixes, test login screens, test registration screens, forgot password screens, test UI, and logging should all be implemented are among the stories for the SNHU Travel project.

Two-week sprints with a target or aim of 196 story points are known as sprint planning and sprints. To decide which stories to deliver in the next sprint, the scrum master, product owner, and team members collaborate during sprint planning. The team will go through each story after selecting which ones to present, checking that the title, description, and story points are right and making any necessary modifications.

The Scrum Master coordinates sprint planning, selecting the sprint's start, end, and goal dates. Team members reassign tasks to themselves and update a story's status from "To Do" to "In Progress" after creating a sprint.

There are daily Scrum Meetings accessible, lasting between 15 and 30 minutes, led by the Scrum Master. These sessions' primary goals are to review the Sprint's progress, talk about areas for improvement, and deal with any obstacles.

After half of the sprint has been finished, the Scrum Master calls the Mid-Iteration Review Meeting. Examining all outstanding stories in the Sprint in JIRA and talking about ideas for improvement is the key agenda item.

To put it briefly, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a methodical approach to project development that includes a number of processes, including requirements analysis, requirements collection, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The Agile Methodology and the Waterfall Model are essential elements of this process, both with pros and cons of their own.

After a Sprint is over, the Scrum Master will have a Retro meeting to go over areas for improvement, lessons learned, and accomplishments. At the meeting, we'll discuss ideas, go over IDea boards, and determine which stories are finished or not. The leftover tales will be carried over to the following Sprint if not.

The Scrum Master will then determine which stories to finish in the upcoming sprint during sprint planning. From the backlog, every story will be found, and a sprint will be formed. Each story will be reviewed by the team, and any necessary adjustments will be made to the title, description, and plot points. Teams will assign stories to themselves after learning the sprint goal and timeframe.

The Scrum Master will scramble each day, and team members should report their work statuses at a scrum call. They should email the Scrum Master if they are unable to participate in the call.
